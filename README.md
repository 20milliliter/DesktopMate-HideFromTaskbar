# DesktopMate - Hide From Taskbar

This mod hides the primary DesktopMate window from the taskbar when it runs, to prevent taskbar clutter.

## Usage
When DesktopMate's main scene is finished initializing, the mod will automatically attempt to hide the primary DesktopMate window from the taskbar.

If this fails for some reason, "F8" can be pressed to retry.
